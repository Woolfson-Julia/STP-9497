            <p>Yes, Space Rush is entirely free to download and play. There are no paywalls, no required in-app
              purchases,
              and no
              subscription fees. The core gameplay is fully accessible from the start, and all performance is based on
              your reflexes
              and focus. We believe in delivering a fair, skill-driven experience that rewards players based on
              ability—not spending.
              Optional ads may offer rewards, but they’re never intrusive. Our goal is to provide a clean, ad-light,
              user-friendly
              gameplay loop.</p>

            <p>No, Space Rush is fully playable offline. You can enjoy the entire game without Wi-Fi or mobile data.
              This
              makes
              it perfect for travel, commutes, or areas with limited connectivity. Any high scores you achieve offline
              will be
              saved locally and synced to the leaderboard once your device reconnects. Events and minor updates will
              require
              internet, but core gameplay is always available.</p>

            <p>The control system is intentionally simple: just tap the screen to change the direction of your shooting
              star.
              The game is built around one-thumb gameplay, so it's perfect for mobile use with minimal distractions.
              Timing is
              key—each tap changes your path along the orbit, and a single mistake could lead to a collision. As the
              speed
              increases, your reflexes and precision will be tested. It's easy to learn, but difficult to master.</p>

            <p>Your main goal is to keep the star moving along its square orbit without crashing. Collect rotating baits
              that
              appear within the orbit to increase your score. As time passes, the speed of the orbit increases,
              demanding
              sharper reflexes and tighter control. Reaching 1000 points is considered a high-tier achievement. The
              longer
              you
              survive, the more galaxies you'll unlock through visual shifts and escalating challenge.</p>

            <p>Baits are rotating collectibles that appear along your orbital path. Each one adds points to your total
              score.
              While it may seem easy at first, collecting them requires careful navigation around corners and increasing
              speed.
              Missing them isn't fatal, but collecting them boosts your progress and personal records. Some baits may
              trigger
              minor speed-ups or visual effects, so each one you collect adds both challenge and reward.</p>

            <p>Yes, Space Rush features a global leaderboard where players can compete for the highest score. Scores are
              saved
              locally and synced online when your device connects to the internet. You can also see your personal best
              and
              track
              how your reflexes are improving over time. Weekly challenges and milestone records are planned for future

            <p>Absolutely. While the game starts at a relaxed pace, it gradually increases in difficulty the longer you
              survive.
              Speed increments kick in based on time and score, forcing players to react more quickly and accurately.
              After 500
              points, the difficulty curve steepens dramatically, testing both your muscle memory and timing. The game
              rewards
              patience, practice, and rhythm.</p>

            <p>Yes, Space Rush is optimized for a wide range of Android devices, including tablets and older
              smartphones.
              The
              game has a lightweight install size and runs smoothly without heavy graphics requirements. All interface

            <p>Yes, the game includes minimal ads, but they are never disruptive. You won't be interrupted during

              Optional reward ads are available after crashes if you want a bonus retry or additional points. If you
              prefer an
              ad-free experience, a one-time in-app purchase will remove them permanently. We've designed the ad system
